Null-steering    for    interference    suppression    is achieved  by  adjusting  the  weights  of  array  elements. Simultaneously,   it   is   always   desirable   to   keep   the beamwidth  and  the  peak  sidelobe  level  (SLL)  within  a   required   level.   This   is   realized   by   solving   min optimization   problem   subjected   to   three   constrains, namely,  SLL  limits,  the  prescribed  location  of  the  null points and acceptable broadening of the main lobe. The problem can be described as follows:
